# Train MNIST with PyTorch
This is the pytroch example and training on mnist.

# Model
LeNet-5 
reference: LECUN, Yann, et al. Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998, 86.11: 2278-2324.

# Learning rate adjustment
I manually change the lr during training

# Data augmentation
1. Convert a PIL Image or numpy.ndarray to tensor.
2. Normalize a tensor image with mean and standard deviation
